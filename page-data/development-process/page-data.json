You can use React components directly from the IBM Carbon Design System or, if you can't find what you need, create your own Carbon Add-on components in React. A Carbon add-on is a custom component that conforms to the IBM Carbon Design System guidelines. Some sample add-on components are provided in the repository for reference. You can do your front-end development in parallel with your back-end development or in isolation.\n\n- Use the standard Cúram client development environment (CDEJ) to create UIM pages and create Java renderers to render your components on UIM pages in the web client application.\n\n## Getting started with Carbon React JavaScript development\n\nThe Carbon Design System provides design guidance for the development of user interface components based on the Carbon Design System and implemented in a number of frameworks, including React.\n\n- For more information about IBM Carbon Design System, see the [Carbon website](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) and the [Carbon Storybook](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/getting-started-welcome--welcome).\n\n- If you are new to Carbon and React development, see [Carbon React Frameworks](https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/frameworks/react/) and the [Carbon React tutorial](https://.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview/), and the Facebook [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md) documentation to get you started.\n\n# Back-end development\n\nUsing the Cúram server development environment and GraphQL functionality, implement domain definitions and the services (business logic) to create/update/get the data for your components.
